A purple-y and dreamy IDE theme based on this illustration of Bee's bedroom from the show "Bee and PuppyCat", from the [Frederator Studios blog](https://frederator-studios.frederator.com/):

I am in love with the whole aesthetic of the show & especially appreciate any kind of atmospheric, detailed backdrop I can set as my wallpaper. Also, quite honestly, I got a new laptop and just wanted to match my wallpaper to my editor theme.

(Right now I only have an .xccolortheme, as Xcode is the main editor I use. Maybe when I'm not lazy I'll release VS Code and Sublime Text compatible versions.)
